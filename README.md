**About**

**_Layered Design for Ruby on Rails Applications_** by Vladimir Dementyev introduces a structured approach to building maintainable and scalable Rails applications. The book explores Rails' core abstractions, highlights common pitfalls like fat models and controllers, and guides developers in extracting clean, modular layers such as query objects, form objects, service layers, and presenters. It expands on The Rails Way by layering in new design patterns for authorization, notifications, configuration, and infrastructure, all while maintaining productivity and developer happiness.
